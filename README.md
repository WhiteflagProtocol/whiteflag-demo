# Whiteflag Demo Application

## Introduction

[Whiteflag](https://whiteflagprotocol.org/) is a fully neutral and secure
communciations protocol based on blockchain technology. It enables near
real-time communication in armed conflicts and disasters to exchange early
warning and status information to create shared situational awareness.
The [Whiteflag Protocol specification](https://standard.whiteflagprotocol.org/)
is an open standard.

The Whiteflag Demo Application provides a graphical user interface that
demonstrates what real-world interactions are possible between organisatons
and people in conflict and disaster areas using Whiteflag. It shows how a
neutral and secure technology may help to create situational awareness,
provide proof of life and report emergency situations.

## Planning

The project is currently in planning. More details will follow soon.
